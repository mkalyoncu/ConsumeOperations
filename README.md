# Consume Operations

Consume Operations is a simple message receiving system.


#### Example of a message
  
```json
{
    "name":"fireman",
    "user_id":
    {
        "hash":"4FE814ABB1ADB58A7788269DE4408C8F",
        "user_id":517
    }
}
```
  
As you see, this package contains more than a username. The app assigns auto incremented id numbers and hash values(which are generated by DigestUtils) for each username.
